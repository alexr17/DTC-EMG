# DTC-EMG 

Winter 2018

A group of 4 students in my Design Thinking and Communication (DTC) class at Northwestern University was tasked with building a simple interface to visualize an electromyographic (EMG) signal by the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in downtown Chicago. Although there are certain softwares on the market that visualize a different types of signals within electrophysiology, the AbilityLab desired one tailored to their needs that the patient could understand.

I built a rudimentary client-side website that took a signal and produced an interactive bar graph and "star bucket". I chose to write almost entirely in Javascript and JQuery given my strengths at the time and the need for easy access. To present it I just put the website in an AWS bucket that the researchers at the AbilityLab could access. The bucket runs a pre-recorded file on a loop.
